                                Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction, where the body
                                attacks itself by mistake, stopping the production of insulin. It's usually diagnosed in
                                children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to take
                                insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.

                                With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at
                                normal levels. It's usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens,
                                and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it's important to get your blood
                                sugar tested if you're at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy
                                lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.

                            Geriatric people, often referred to as senior citizens or the elderly, are individuals who
                            have reached an advanced age. This stage of life typically begins at the age of 65 or older.
                            Aging is a natural process that brings about various physical, mental, and emotional
                            changes.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            As people age, they may face challenges related to mobility, chronic health conditions,
                            memory decline, and social isolation. However, it's crucial to recognize that each person's
                            aging journey is unique, and many seniors maintain active and fulfilling lives.
                        </p>

                            Caring for geriatric individuals requires compassion, understanding, and tailored support.
                            Providing access to quality healthcare, social interactions, and mental stimulation can
                            significantly enhance their well-being and overall quality of life.
